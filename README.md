<b>Loan Defaulter<b>

This project aims to build a classification model which can predict if the loan can be defaulted by a person given the loan and some personal information provided. Users can use this model as a reference tool for any financial institution in the decision-making process of whether to approve the loan to the loan appliers. By applying it, an institution can do the risk analysis maximizing the profit. Loans can be of various types, including 
     ● Cash Loan 
     ● Personal/Consumer Loan 
     ● Revolving Loan  
  If a new applicant is less likely or not able to pay back the loan amount or credit, it is not an economical step to approve the loan. Thus, it helps financial institutions by avoiding the loss of funds.
